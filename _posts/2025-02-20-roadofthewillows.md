On this road, where I now belong<br />
come to the land of death, willows weep<br />
for those now gone, to think<br />
all these years no person visits.

The rafters in this house<br />
smell of old cedar wood, with<br />
its wrinkle and stains.

But it is the shadows, on the wall<br />
that keep me company, it's as if<br />
I don't need others with me<br />
as I wait for grim's grasp, its stare<br />
chills my skin and pores.

Outside is the trees, willows from<br />
years gone by, that presents this old tomb<br />
as the one true company that I need.<br />
Come noble steep, embrace me,<br />
When I hope to bleed quickly, with no suffering.

For ones time has come, to see the world,<br />
fade away to timber ash.

The rafters in this house<br />
smell of old cedar wood, with<br />
its wrinkle and stains.

With only a smell,<br />
That's quite profane.
