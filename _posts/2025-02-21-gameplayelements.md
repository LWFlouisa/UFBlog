## LANGAUGE CHANGES
Currently in the process of switches to programming in C, although certain things I will still need to develop in Ruby, such as menu screens.

## CURRENT PLOTLINE
While the original plot continues to be based around Sister Chaos and Sister Order, the plot has since been expanding to include monster taming mechanics, the process of turning from a human to the undead, and back again. As well as other systems components.

## GAMEPLAY
Gameplay revolves around a lunar calender and different subsets of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which will over take be expanding into different gameplay loops. And if I produce a tiles version, will likely be Octogonal in approach. I will expand more on the monster taming elements as time allows.
