This essay is about why I no longer use the --punk prefix when describing the works of fiction and poetry that I write. When you think of the word Punk, what is the first thing that comes to mind? Is the anarchist that tries to make their community a better place? Sounds like a recipe for dystopia to me. Or is it someone like Cid Vicious, whom is a controversial figure at the very least, within the canon of Punk Rock.

Often when the word punk is used in science fiction genres, often the word punk itself isn’t even alluding to the music genre in most cases, but rather is more closely derived from the word for Prostitute in the 19th century. To say that that’s not the kind of image I want for my fiction is putting it mildly, because except it certain cases, I don’t think my fiction has ever revolved around prostitutes as main characters except in very select circumstances.

This is also in light of two different facts about my life: my music genre, while I have listened to Punk Rock in the past, and also especially gothic rock, I’ve been as a musician more moving in the direction of combining chip tune music with elements of Gothic Progressive Metal and Doom Jazz music, and a lot of my style contradicts some of the original ideology that composed of Punk Rock culture, this disdain for musical complexity.

In addition, I’ve become disenchanted with anarchism, because way to people confuse anarchism with a more enthusiastic form of liberalism, a type of hyper-liberalism, rather than moving on from the need to have organizations with a centralized leadership in their entirety. Which is what anarchists usually mean when we say “Stateless Societies”.

But I’m also increasingly preferring the prefix --moire, which denotes a type of interference pattern that is created with creating two layers of a pattern, and slightly offsetting the original pattern. I find that this is an apt metaphor for what I aim to achieve for my own aesthetic experiences I jot down on paper and type on the page.

It works around issues like people trying to hijack control of certain genre labels, by making the concept more of an abstraction rather than a concrete reality, and more about the aesthetic of the thing, rather than tied to an existing culture. A made up culture built around interference as a type of visual aesthetic removed from the out dated notion of once constitutes.

I am a moire creator,

The undersigned.
