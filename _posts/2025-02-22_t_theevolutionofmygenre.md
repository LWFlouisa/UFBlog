The evolution of my own genre came out of the Cyberpunk tradition, although more often than I care to admit I often get compared to Steampunk, especially my children's fiction. But my Cyberpunk has always tended to be low-key more like a technological version of of Dreampunk, with virtual reality systems becoming more subtle over time, with espionage agents exploring the dreams of those they spy on.

This has meant that when combining my adult fiction and middle grade, I often end up venturing into this largely unknown territory where I combine elements of Steampunk and Cyberpunk into one genre, and emphasizing the Gothier aspects of my writerly personality. Which is something I'm still coming to grips with as I finish this Uploaded Fairy Side story.

But typically Steampunk is more frequently associated with the UK rather than France, with the exception of certain authors like Jules Verne. With Lemony Snicket being one example. This has meant somewhat feeling out of place in a traditional Steampunk context, because my main interest is in French true crime cases,

Uploaded Fairy, and specifically the prequel that became wrapped into the rest of the novel, became thus the product of two different ways of exploring counter-culture: Steampunk and Cyberpunk, with elements of Dreampunk. Hemato-Tomato specifically is the first in a lineage of genetically engineered vampires which I'll be expanding on in later stories.

There was also a time I had considered the idea of calling my work "Reverse Steampunk" to deal with some of the descrepancies, such as having mainly digital technology, with the occassionally out of place technology like having Guillotines used in the present day. Which is probably also why some people confused my work for the 1950s, given that my color palette of choice tends to still be fairly close to black and white in nature.

But I ended up settling on the term "Guillotine Western", as the requirements are somewhat different from Steampunk: the default means of capital punishment must be a beheading machine like a guillotine, dreadful climb, or other such devices, but specifically in a context for which there are not ordinarily such devices: the American wild west. Thus a bandit girl who is sentenced to death in this type of western would be beheaded rather than hung. The other requirement is that it must mainly be in the French language, and fashion culture taking inspiration from Alsatian-French and Japanese Gothic Lolita.

Because of that, it has meant that my stuff would be a sub-genre within Steampunk, even before combining it with Cyberpunk elements. Which is the real reason why sometimes characters will wear Wooden SHoes rather than steel toe boots, even though the end effect is almost the same.
