The evolution of my own genre came out of the Cyberpunk tradition, although more often than I care to admit I often get compared to Steampunk, especially my children's fiction. But my Cyberpunk has always tended to be low-key more like a technological version of of Dreampunk, with virtual reality systems becoming more subtle over time, with espionage agents exploring the dreams of those they spy on.

This has meant that when combining my adult fiction and middle grade, I often end up venturing into this largely unknown territory where I combine elements of Steampunk and Cyberpunk into one genre, and emphasizing the Gothier aspects of my writerly personality. Which is something I'm still coming to grips with as I finish this Uploaded Fairy Side story.

But typically Steampunk is more frequently associated with the UK rather than France, with the exception of certain authors like Jules Verne. With Lemony Snicket being one example. This has meant somewhat feeling out of place in a traditional Steampunk context, because my main interest is in French true crime cases,

Uploaded Fairy, and specifically the prequel that became wrapped into the rest of the novel, became thus the product of two different ways of exploring counter-culture: Steampunk and Cyberpunk, with elements of Dreampunk. Hemato-Tomato specifically is the first in a lineage of genetically engineered vampires which I'll be expanding on in later stories.
