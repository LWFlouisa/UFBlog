## New Approach For Game Design
I'm currently in the process of switching the way that I organize my game design framework:

~~~
module ArtificialGeneology
  class ColorHighlighting
  end

  class LunarCalender
  end

  class FamilialLineage
  end

  class Mentor
  end

  class Player
  end

  class Enemy
  end
end
~~~

The idea behind this approach is that Color Highlighting will be determined before the lunar calender begins, but its all covered by the framework itself. The Lunar calender is presenting first based on what the current lunar phase is, then the start of the game will present the previous familial ancestor in the order of ancestors and descendants. Then we present information that the mentor must pass down to the player, then it cycles between the enemy and the player. Not very elegant as I haven't figured out how to display the dungeon yet.

## Mastodon Transphbia
I finally managed to get the Mastodon.social flagship instance to reverse the suspension, but the fact that trans people like myself even get suspended over transphobia, when to be transgendered means that by definition one is also trans, is completely incomprehensible to me. As it turns out, I was suspending because Comicsgate people were filing false transphobia reports against me on that platform as part of a targeted harassment campaign against me.

This is why we don't need to have rules like this, without checking to make sure the person we're suspending is not in fact left-wing themselves or transgendered. What's even more unbelievable is the fact that this instance supposedly resides in Germany, where I thought there were laws against targeted harassment of trans people.

The way that susupensions are determined on Mastodon and activitypub needs a severe overhaul.
