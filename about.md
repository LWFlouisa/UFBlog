This is my game design, webcomic syndicating, and short story publishing newsletter.

I will be syndicating some of my older short stories, while I write up some game design articles, and syndicating my old webcomic.

My short stories can be found here: [Short Stories](https://lwflouisa.github.io/ShortFiction/page/11/)
Screenplay Version: [Script](https://lwflouisa.github.io/UploadedFairyOELN/screenplay.html)

## Lunar RPS
If you want to try out the prototype for the games I develop, you can find it here: [Yumemoire](https://github.com/LWFlouisa/Yumemoire.git)

Note I will never be publishing my work on Steam, so please give that up if that's what you're here for.
